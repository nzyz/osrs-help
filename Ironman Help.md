#**!!!!!!!!!!CONTINUE HERE!!!!!!!!!!!!**

[] Do the Regicide quest
 Pick up a few whiteberries just north of the elf tracker

[] Finish Enlightened journey if you didn't already
 Unlock Castle wars and Varrock balloons for diaries

[] Go to the small island at fossil island with the bank, where you dive to seaweed patches
Make 2 lantern lenses before using all of your molten glass

[] Dive down and blow all of your molten glass into unpowered orbs
 The goal here is to pick up the seaweed spores that spawn every now and then
  Like this: <https://i.imgur.com/ecDT2Az.png>
  The spores can spawn north of the anchor so make sure you're checking the minimap and not just your item overlay
  I was getting around 25 spores/h while doing this, it's not much but it'll get you started.
Plant seaweed after you get your first 2 spores.

[] Do Hand in the sand quest, get daily sand every day

[] Do these quests while fletching darts:
 Big chompy bird hunt
 Rag and bone man (first part, should have all bones in bank already)
 Family crest
 Start Legend's quest (Get vanilla pod for RFD)
 Death plateau
 Troll Stronghold

I'll assume you have fletched all of the darts now.

[] Go back to the seaweed patches to pick up the random seaweed spores.
Fletch maple shortbows (u) until 55 fletching
Fletch all of your maple logs into maple longbows (u)
 You will get a weight warning but you can just ignore that, it makes no difference unless you go to the deep water
 Make sure to leave some maple logs for birdhouses

[] Buy 2300 gold ore from blast furnace ore shop, 2 invs per world
Get goldsmith gauntlets
Get 60 smithing

[] Go to Edgeville
Craft the gold bars into gold BRACELETS, leave like 30 bars for teleport jewellery if you need to make more
 Reminder to buy rubies from either keldagrim or kourend castle gem stalls if you run out
 The reason we are doing bracelets instead of amulets is the extra 120gp per high alch, which is worth more than 5xp

[] Get mage arena cape while you're here anyway
Buy another ~6k nats (from mage bank, get some cosmics too)
 HCIM; if scared, you should still have enough nats to get 63mage with alching, and then you can boost to get into wizard guild.

[] Do agility until full graceful
 Alch your gold bracelets and maple bows while doing agility
 Loot kingdom and fletch more longbows to alch if you run out. Finish graceful even if you don't have enough alchs.

[] Should get to around 70 mage by the time you're done with agility for now

[] Do all of the RFD subquests
 Get 70 cooking at the Hosidius mess hall if you didn't get 70 from 3tick fishing
Buy a bunch of chocolate dust from the chest and make energy pots

[] Do A soul's bane quest
Complete Varrock medium diary
 About daily bstaffs, I personally don't bother with them nowadays since you get so much gp anyway. If you want to do them then
 i'd recommend to at least wait until 59rc so you can rc double cosmics

[] Get crafting supplies for 61 crafting, make molten glass at Edgeville
 Burn your giant seaweed into soda ash
 Put house into Yanille and fill your buckets with sand, bank at G.E using varrock tele after medium diary
  Lazy edit: do sandstone mining instead, it's a lot faster
 I don't have exact number on how many sand and ash you need, you can calculate it like so:
  (303000-Current xp) / 72.5
[] Get 61 craft, might as well do it underwater again for some seaweed spores

1.5 Diaries and finishing RFD

[] Plant some Toadflax seeds, agility potion is needed soon for a quest
 If you didn't get 99 thieving for master farmers or don't have toadflax seed for some other reason, you can do a bit of brimhaven
 agility arena and get 2 toadflax from there
Make a mithril grapple

[] Do these quests for QP and diaries:
[] Another slice of H.A.M
[] Icthlarin's little helper
[] Eagles' peak
[] Enakhra's lament
[] Rat catchers
[] Olaf's quest
[] Between a rock
[] Tai bwo wannai trio
[] Zogre flesh eater
[] Rum deal & Cabin fever (Req 42 slayer, you should be close to it. Get a task from Mazchna for Mory diary if you don't have one)
 For the 47 prayer req, you can use the ancient mace spec to boost
[] One small favour
[] Watchtower quest

[] Do all easy and medium diaries
 Wildy and fremmy mediums require higher slayer, leave those for when you go back to slayer.
 You probably don't have a crystal key for fally medium diary yet so leave that for later as well.
 For Lumby 50 range req I'd recommend ranging at pest control with bone cbow
  If you're not 70cb for intermediate boat then go do slayer now, train attack to 60 then defense until 70cb
  May as well stay until you get 250pts for void bottoms, good mage def. Need 55 range eventually anyway for red chins.

[] Do Slayer until 60 attack
 Buy Dragon scim and Dragon battleaxe

[] Do Eadgar's ruse
[] Do My arm's big adventure
[] Do Desert Treasure
 Get as much herb xp you can get from banked herbs and then open wintertodt crates for the mage logs if you didn't get them early.
  If you didn't get any mage logs from the crates then your best option would probably be nature implings in puro puro
  Could also do more wintertodt, even at 55hp and 90fm you're only taking 3dmg from the regular hits
  Training woodcutting is of course also an option

[] Finish RFD, buy B gloves
 Here's a video of me killing the bosses with stats from following this guide, not too difficult:
 <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv1h-4grhks>

2. Goals after Barrows gloves

[] Get 72 mining and do Lunar's diplomacy
 By far the best method for this is to fill up the sandstone machine(25k buckets worth), then claim however much sand you need for
 80 crafting, and fill it again. Doing this will get you most of the sand you need for 93 crafting.
  Bring 7 waterskins for a 50min trip, drop them as they empty for more inv space.
 Only 60 mining is needed for now so you can do this in bits if you want to, but i'd recommend 72 for making friends with my arm and
 to complete fremmy hard diary very early for the shortcut

[] Do Magic training arena for bones to peaches (diary req) and infinity boots. Should get you 77 magic if you've been alching maples
 Can also get master wand if you want, mage's book i'd say isn't really worth especially if you got tome of fire from WT.

[] Get 80 crafting
 If you don't have enough giant seaweed yet, just get whatever level you can for now.
Make at least 2 glories, put one in your house for the teleports. Make a ring of wealth to use during slayer
 This is of course if you've gotten crystal keys or dragonstone drops yet, which you very well might not have.
Next few dragonstones should probably be skills necks for farming contracts

[] Get a helm of neitiznot
[] Get a fighter torso from BA
[] Get a dragon defender
 If you didn't fish for str levels then you're gonna have to do some slayer before defenders to get access to warrior's guild.
 Train defense to 60 while getting defenders

Read the rest of the guide so you'll know what's coming

[] Start slaying. Plenty of garbage tasks early on, but just gotta deal with them.
 Should have plenty of ranarrs from master farmers if you don't want to pray flick.

Prioritize slayer points on;
Blocks*> Superior slayer > Slayer ring unlock > Blocks* > Herb sack/Slayer helm > Broads/Garg finisher > Extensions
 *Read the block list

vvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvv
How you slay doesn't really make a difference nowadays, farming contracts give you enough herb seeds so just slay how you want to
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Use Nieve until 100 combat
Nieve Block/Skip list (This is how I slay, you don't have to do the same depending on your preferences)

Block:
[] Suqah    (Block these asap)
[] Black demon  (Trash, skip if no points to block)
[] Kalphite   (Block after superiors and rings, you can kill the low lvls for fast points)
[] Hellhound   (Block after superiors and rings, do them if you don't have 100pts, not worth skipping)

Skip:
Iron dragon
Steel dragon
Scabarites
Brine rats
Turoth (Not terrible but I wouldn't do these, definitely skip before herb sack)
Waterfiends

Some additional notes:
The only task I ever extend is nechryals
I use the expeditious bracelets on all short tasks like ankou, black dragon
The only tasks I use slaughter bracelets are:
 lizardman shaman(flick it for kill) before DWH
 Abby demons before whip if I don't bother boosting for it
 Krakens before trident.

Get 58 slayer and camp for a black mask, do clues for black dhide
Do Slayer until level 70

If you're fletching maples for some afk time, stop making longbows at around 75 fletching and make arrow shafts instead
 Need around 700k arrow shafts(11.6k maple logs) if you're going for 99 fletching
 The whole process of making broad arrows is roughly 180k xp/h even if you just bankstand, so a lot better than maple longs
 Broad arrows instead of bolts is because arrows are only 5.8gp/xp compared to bolts which are like 20gp/xp

Regular ironman:
Kill green dragons for 70 prayer, use them at wildy altar
 Use loot bag and bank hides also, make dhide bodies
Unlock piety

Next few goals:
100% all zeah favours
100 combat via slayer
Get Void range from Pest control

Hunt 2500 red chins (skip this if you've already got 70 range from some other method)
Start MM2, chin to 70 range
Complete Western provinces hard diary
 Get 60 construction with this method: <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFH6-oJrJ0o>

Get elite void
Hunt red chins until ~92 hunter, get +90 range
Fire cape
Quest cape, SOTE quest boss is pretty hard without brews so you can leave that quest for later.
 HCIM: Myth's guild green dragons for 70 prayer, use gilded altar

Switch to Duradel, karamja gloves 3 or npc contact for new tasks
Unlock lizardman tasks, msb(i) and rune arrows or rcbow and runite bolts are very decent at 90+ range against shamans
Unblock black demons until 4 zenytes
 I just leave the shards in bank until i get a trident, then i go get chaos runes from barrows
Slayer until trident
 complete hard diaries at some point during that grind to mix it up a little

Duradel block/skip list (once again, this is just my preference)

Block:
Abyssal demon (after maybe 5 whip drops, keep suqah blocked until then)
Black demon  (after zenytes)
Kalphite   
Hellhound   (unblock temporarily when you wanna do cerb)
Cave Kraken  (after trident and tentacle)
Greater demon

Skip:
Suqah (Do 1 task if you need teeth for spirit tree payment)
Spiritual creatures
Trolls
Fire giant
Iron dragon
Steel dragon
Scabarites
Brine rats
Turoth
Kurask (I think they're garbage even if you get a leaf baxe)
Waterfiends

Some additional notes:
The only task I ever extend is nechryals
I use the expeditious bracelets on all short tasks like ankou, black dragon
The only tasks I use slaughter bracelets are:
 lizardman shaman(flick it for kill) before DWH
 Abby demons before whip if I don't bother boosting for it
 Krakens before trident.

3. PVM preparation, Barrows, Zulrah

After trident:
 Get 83 or higher herblore, boost with botanical pie to anti venoms
 Get 82 construction with teaks, make the mounted myth cape for higher xp/plank
  You could go get a dragon axe from dks before this but even with rune axe it's not that much slower
 Boost +8 const for the highest tier pool
 Get 93 crafting
 Do barrows for 120k chaos runes and buy 4 onyxes for the zenytes
  If you get lucky with all the good items first then just buy the rest of the runes
  fury is kinda useless so i'd just wait until onyx drop from zulrah

Kill Zulrah for the uniques

I'll be ending the guide here, you can pretty much do anything you want now that you have trident, blowpipe, barrows, zenytes etc.

Hope you enjoyed this guide.
